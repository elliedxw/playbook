          <h1>Support and on call</h1>
          <p>We have service definitions for
<a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/930612236449495">GovPress hosting</a>,
<a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/754953588860938">container hosting</a>
and secure WordPress hosting for our
<a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/355674790119695">blogging platform</a>
and
<a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/691308552308120">campaign multisites</a>
through G-Cloud.</p>

<p>We have agreed service levels for each client we provide support for. Our
standard terms, including prioritisation definitions and response times, are
detailed in our
<a href="https://contracts.dxw.com/service_level_agreement.md">Service Level Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>With our default support plan we will manage all code, maintenance, updates and
uptime monitoring and provide security event monitoring intended to detect and
prevent attacks. Users can also use our helpdesk service for help with any
aspect of their site.</p>

<p>Our Managed Plus plan is for clients with higher assurance requirements. It
includes all the fully-managed features of our default support plan, plus a
quarterly site review meeting, a named delivery manager and an enhanced SLA with
faster response targets.</p>

<p>We provide support for clients and users of these services in three ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clients and users of these services can raise a <strong>ticket</strong> with us about
usability issues, errors or faults. Sometimes what they’re asking for is a
larger feature request, which needs separate handling.</li>
  <li>We do proactive <strong>maintenance</strong> for our client’s sites and services, for
example by applying security updates.</li>
  <li>We have monitoring systems for our services that continually check whether
they are operating correctly, and whether there are any warning signs of
problems. When problems are detected they raise an <strong>alert</strong> for the team to
investigate and resolve.</li>
</ul>

<p>That support is handled by the team in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We provide in-hours (10.00–18.00) support for all our clients, resolving
tickets and alerts and doing maintenance. We call this <strong>first line support</strong>,
and it’s staffed by a developer and an ops engineer on rota.</li>
  <li>We provide out-of-hours (24/7) support for some of our clients, responding
only to critical alerts and emergency tickets. We call this <strong>on call</strong>, and
it’s staffed by a developer or an ops engineer through an opt-in rota.</li>
</ul>

<p>Being able to do support effectively requires access to most of our production
systems, so you’ll be added to the support rotas once you’ve completed your
vetting. You might shadow someone else on support before your vetting is
completed.</p>

<h2 id="being-on-first-line-support">Being on first line support</h2>

<p>Support tickets come in from clients and users every day. These tickets could
relate to any of the products we currently support, which are a mixture of Rails

reasons. If a project has been running for a long time, it is often beneficial
to introduce some new ideas to the team, and to give incumbent team members a

the scope of the project might change, requiring a different set of skills to
those provided by the existing team. It’s normal that changes need to happen.
Whatever the reason, it’s critical that we ensure personnel changes and
handovers:
  Maintain the momentum of the team and the project
  Are handled efficiently and with clarity
  Are well understood and agreed to by the individual, the client, and the team
  Ensure an effective transfer of knowledge
  Work well in the context of other ongoing dxw projects
